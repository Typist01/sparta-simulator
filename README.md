***TASK***
*Build a simulator which will help track the number of people currently training with Sparta Global.*

**Phase One**
PART ONE: 
-The tracker needs to be able to track time in a consistent way.  
-The program starts by asking how long the simulation will run (e.g number of months/ Neil said ideally program runs for years)  
-Every month, a random number of trainees are generated, wanting to be trained (50-100)
-Every 2 months, Sparta Global opens training centers; opens instantly and can take trainees every month  
-A center can train a max of 100 trainees and takes a random number (0-50) of trainees, not going over capacity  
-If a center is full, trainees can be moved to an empty one  
-If all are full, trainees go on a waiting list, and are prioritized over newer trainees  
-At simulation end, output should show:  
-number of open centers  
-number of full centers  
-number of trainees currently training  
-number of trainees in waiting list

**SOLUTION**
